#### For the analytics part, I had told to Professor. Andrew. And he agree with I can just skip this part and don't worry about it. Since the Google Analytics don't allow me to create a web stream. We don't know how to fix it.

#### All of my code is written by myself. 

#### For the backend app, can directly use the command line in the "CURL.md" file. There are examples that for all my api endpoint curl command line.
#### For the client app, can use the link "https://final-project-350706.uc.r.appspot.com/analytics/dashboard". It will show a web front end and there have instruction showing in the website. And for POST new staff please fill out all the text fields and image as well. And for the search, you can don't input anything and it will return all of staffs information. Or you can either input name or input title or input both to search. (Take care of the capital letter and lower case letter). Searching should be exact same as the staff information. For updating, you have to make sure the staffid is same and input whatever text fields to update the information. For computing tax, just click the button. For balance check, you should input a valid number in the income text field.
