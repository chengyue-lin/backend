#### This app collect collects all staff information in the company, aggregates it on a server. It can compute the tax for each staff and it can check the company is "balance income and salary", which means if total income is less than total salary, then it will fire some staffs who get the lowest performance score. For functionality happening on the client and backend, it is basic same. The difference between is backend need the API-KEY but client does not need it. And my cloud function combinate with the scheduled task which happen hourly. The cloud function create a new entity in the datastore with the timestamp and the kind is "health_check". For the monthly cost, users check their account twice a day, user make 2 post a day, each post contain a 500KB image. User will update information 50 times per weeks since user need to at least update the performance score. Assume user check account cost 0.000015 per time and post a new staff cost 0.0000002 and each update need to cost 0.000001. Thus, the total cost will be 4\*50\* 0.000001*1000000 + 30\*0.000015 \* 2\*1000000 + 30\*0.0000002\*2\*1000000 = 1112 dollar per month.
